# Project Rules for Codex (PFChecker)

## Language / Runtime
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment may be used (.venv)

## How to Run
- Main entry point: clarify before running
- Do NOT invent execution commands
- Ask if the run command is unclear

## Testing
- Prefer pytest if tests exist
- If no tests exist, do NOT invent fake tests
- When adding features, add minimal tests only if reasonable

## Code Style
- Follow existing code style
- Do NOT reformat unrelated code
- Avoid large refactors unless explicitly requested

## Git Rules
- Modify only files relevant to the task
- Do NOT touch .gitignore unless requested
- Do NOT commit automatically

## Safety
- Do NOT delete files unless explicitly instructed
- Preserve existing behavior unless change is requested

## Communication
- Explain what files were changed and why
- If assumptions are required, state them explicitly
